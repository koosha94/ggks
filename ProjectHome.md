Grinnell GPU K-Selection is a suite of CUDA implementations for solving a k-selection problem on a graphics processing unit.  The original contributions in the software are two algorithms, bucketSelect and radixSelect, a testing suite for comparing k-selection algorithms, and implementations of other k-selection algorithms from other authors.  This software package was used in the experimental portion of paper:
